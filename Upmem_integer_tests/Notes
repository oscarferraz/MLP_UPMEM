This folder presents an MLP with fake weights and matrices in integer to assess speed only. Was used for preleminary testing and should be irrelevant.

Sequential code in CPU and single dpu and multithread are implemented.

For dpu dpu_copy_to was used so the data is sent to the DPU in a sequential manner. As it was said this is for perleminary testing only.

mlp_host.c, mlp_dpu.c are for MLP implementation with dpu_copy_to, multithread, single dpu
mlp_host2.c, mlp_dpu2.c are for testing the functions individually

upmem_kernels2.c uses WRAM for KDOT (matrix multiplication), but no blocking is done, so the block in MRAM must be the same same as in WRAM

upmem_kernels2_mram.c uses MRAM for all functions

The sequential CPU code is pretty much straightforward
