This code was used for testing purposes and come to conclusions.

The matrices are copied to a single dpu in a sequential manner using dpu_copy_to, and multi-tasklet matrix multiplication is computed.

3 cofigurations exist:
-MRAM GEMM: MRAM is used
-WRAM1 GEMM: Each mram_read read 1 line only
-WRAM2 GEMM: Each mram_read reads maximum possible lines. (There is a limit on how many elements we can read at once).
