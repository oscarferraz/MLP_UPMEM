This code implements Multi-DPU and Multi-tasklet parallel code to perform infenrece on fake matrices for speed testing purposes.

The weights are generated randomly.

Key takeaways:

V0:
-The seconde matrix in not transposed in this version and the blocks and padding for this matrix are columnwise

-No WRAM

-NR_DPUS*NR_DPUS is used so the "grid" must be square
