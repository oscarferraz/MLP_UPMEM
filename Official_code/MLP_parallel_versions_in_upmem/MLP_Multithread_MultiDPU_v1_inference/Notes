This code implements Multi-DPU and Multi-tasklet parallel code to perform infenrece on the iris dataset.

The weights where generated using a diferent code and this implementation is inference only.

Key takeaways:

V1:
-The seconde matrix in transposed in this version and the blocks and padding for this matrix are row-wise.

-No WRAM

-NR_DPUS1*NR_DPUS2 is used so the "grid" can have any dimentions. This is usefull for workload balance
